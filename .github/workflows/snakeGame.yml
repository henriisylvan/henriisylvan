# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Snake Game

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          
      - uses: Platane/snk@v3
        with:
          # github user name to read the contribution graph from (**required**)
          # using action context var `github.repository_owner` or specified user
          github_user_name: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
      
          # list of files to generate.
          # one file per line. Each output can be customized with options as query string.
          #
          #  supported options:
          #  - palette:     A preset of color, one of [github, github-dark, github-light]
          #  - color_snake: Color of the snake
          #  - color_dots:  Coma separated list of dots color.
          #                 The first one is 0 contribution, then it goes from the low contribution to the highest.
          #                 Exactly 5 colors are expected.
